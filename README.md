**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room wanted to develop a system to support their game, *Draw It or Lose It*, which is a digital version of a drawing and guessing game. They needed a cross-platform application that could manage multiple game instances, track player scores, and handle gameplay logic consistently across Android, iOS, Windows, and web environments. The software required a design that was modular, scalable, and able to support concurrent users.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I did a good job clearly defining the system architecture and outlining how the components would interact. My domain model and use case diagrams were well-organized and showed the main entities, relationships, and behaviors in a way that was easy to understand. Additionally, I provided thorough explanations of design decisions and constraints so that future developers could pick up the project more easily.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

The design document helped me to think through the project in detail before writing any code. By mapping out use cases, identifying classes, and documenting interactions between components, I was given a clear roadmap. This helped refuce confusion and rework because I knew exactly how the system should behave and which classes and methods were needed to implement the core features.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise the class diagram. While I captured the essentials, some relationships and responsibilities could have been more clearly defined. To improve it, I would better define the attributes and methods of each class and clarify how inheritance and composition were applied to reduce duplication and improve cohesion.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I started by carefully reviewing the client's project description and requirements to understand what the end users needed the system to do. I identified the most important user goals, like creating and joining games, tracking scores, and managing game state. These needs were then translated into clear functional requirements and use cases. Considering user needs is important to ensure the final product is both functional and usable. If a design doesn't align with what users expect or require, it can lead to frustration, poor adoption, and costly redesigns.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

My approach started with analyzing the requirements, then modeling the system through diagrams to visualize structure and behavior. I prioritized modular design and reusability to make maintenance easier. In the future, I'd incorporate more prototyping and user feedback to validate assumptions, and I might use tools like UML more extensively to document detailed scenarios. I'd also consider creating mockups to help stakeholders visualize the user interface earlier in the process.
